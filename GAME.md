# Grid Kick

## High Concept

Grid Kick is a round-based football/soccer board game inspired by classic tabletop games. The core mechanic uses a hexagonal grid (13 columns × 15 rows) representing a soccer field.


## The Board

The pitch is laid out on a flat-top hex grid. Use a two-axis coordinate system aligned to the hexes: one axis runs left-to-right across columns, and the other runs top-to-bottom along the grid with the standard hex-column stagger (adjacent columns are vertically offset by half a hex). Each hex is identified by its column and row position in that staggered layout. From any hex, there are six adjacent neighbors: left, right, and four diagonals that follow the hex edges.

Field markings follow standard soccer geometry: goals sit centered on the top and bottom edges of the pitch. The penalty boxes are the rectangular areas directly in front of each goal, spanning inward from the goal line. A single horizontal midline runs across the center of the field, dividing it into top and bottom halves.
